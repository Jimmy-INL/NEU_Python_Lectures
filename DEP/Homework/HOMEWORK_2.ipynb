    "# Mathematical Moon Mission\n",
    "Suppose you work for NASA and you want to help your mathematically illiterate colleague plan a trip to the moon. In particular, he needs to know how much food needs to be packed aboard the spaceship to ensure none of the astronauts go hungry. He tells you the following:\n",
    "- Every astronaut needs $\\textbf{.5}$ kilograms of food a day.\n",
    "- There are $\\textbf{4}$ astronauts\n",
    "- The distance from the launch site to the moon is approximately $\\textbf{384,400}$ kilometers \n",
    "- The average velocity is roughly $\\textbf{1.5}$ kilometers per second. \n",
    "    - We assume time to reach terminal speed and time needed to de-accelerate are negligible. \n",
    "    - This means you can assume the velocity at any given point is 1.5 kilometers per second. \n",
    "        - Of course in reality, you need a higher initial velocity to escape earth's orbit, and once the rocket gets close to the moon, it needs to have enough time to de-accelerate down to zero to avoid a crash landing. \n",
    "        - This is a simple model where the spaceship leaves earth going 1.5 kilometers per second, and magically stops once it gets to the moon. \n",
    "    - The positive direction is the line connecting the launchpad on earth to the moon (we will assume it is a straight line for this problem). \n"
