    "    - \"Not only does computer science provide every student foundational knowledge, it also leads to the highest-paying, fastest-growing jobs in the U.S. economy. There are currently over 500,000 open computing jobs, in every sector, from manufacturing to banking, from agriculture to health care, but only 50,000 computer science graduates a year. \" (Computer Science Education Coalition)\n",
    "    - Note that for specialized computer scientists such as cloud engineers, the expected income is in many cases significantly higher. EG Cloud Engineers starting salary at Amazon is estimated to be over \\$100,000k a year\n",
